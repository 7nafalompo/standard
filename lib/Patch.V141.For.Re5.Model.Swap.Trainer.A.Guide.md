One of the most popular model swap trainers for Resident Evil 5 is the one created by Raz0r and Dante, which is available on Nexus Mods[^1^]. This trainer supports both the Gold Edition and the original version of the game, and has many features and options to enhance your gameplay experience. However, to use this trainer properly, you need to install a patch that fixes some bugs and glitches that occur when swapping characters.
 
This patch is called Patch V1.4.1 For Re5 Model Swap Trainer, and it can be downloaded from the same page as the trainer[^1^].

To install this patch, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download the patch file from Nexus Mods[^1^] and extract it to your Resident Evil 5 folder.
2. Run the patch file as administrator and follow the instructions on the screen.
3. Launch the game and run the model swap trainer as administrator.
4. Check the options you want to use in the trainer's interface.
5. Enjoy playing as your favorite character!

Note: If you encounter any problems or have any questions about using this patch or the trainer, you can visit the forum thread on Nexus Mods[^1^] or watch some tutorial videos on YouTube[^2^] [^3^].
  
In this section, we will explain some of the features and options that you can use with the model swap trainer and the patch. You can access these features and options by clicking on the tabs in the trainer's interface.
 
## Characters Tab
 
This tab allows you to swap the default characters to any other character in the game. You can also change your character's properties, such as invincibility, health, handedness, weapon, size, and speed. To use this tab, you need to check the "Freeze x Player" box to actually change the character. Then, you can select the character you want from the drop-down menu. You can also check the "Ignore Missing Files" box to ignore any missing file, which is necessary for patchless character swap. However, this may cause some errors or crashes, so use it at your own risk.
 
If you want to fix the cutscenes for your swapped character, you can check the "Fix Cutscenes" box. This will make your character's head static during cutscenes, which may look weird but at least it won't disappear. You can also change your character's properties by checking the "Px Freeze Size/Speed" box and adjusting the sliders. However, changing the size or speed of a player not controlled by you may cause severe lags, so be careful with that.
 
If you want to move one player's position to another player's position, you can use the "Move PLx to PLx" button. This can be useful for some situations, such as getting out of bounds or skipping parts of the level. You can also freeze or unfreeze your vehicle's health if you are driving one.
 
## Inventory Tab
 
This tab allows you to edit your inventory items and weapons. You can add any item or weapon to your inventory by selecting it from the drop-down menu and clicking on the "Add Item/Weapon" button. You can also remove any item or weapon from your inventory by selecting it and clicking on the "Remove Item/Weapon" button. You can also edit your item or weapon's properties, such as quantity, ammo, upgrades, and slot.
 
If you want to unlock all items and weapons in the game, you can check the "Unlock All Items/Weapons" box. This will make all items and weapons available in your inventory and in the shop. You can also check the "Infinite Ammo" box to have unlimited ammo for all your weapons. However, this may not work for some weapons, such as grenades or rocket launchers.
 
## Gameplay Tab
 
This tab allows you to modify some gameplay aspects of the game. You can change the game mode, difficulty level, chapter, checkpoint, time limit, score limit, and enemy count. You can also enable or disable some features, such as infinite health, infinite money, infinite time limit, infinite score limit, no reloads, no recoil, rapid fire, one hit kill, no enemy attacks, no enemy spawns, no partner AI attacks, no partner AI spawns.
 
If you want to have some fun with the game physics, you can check the "Enable Physics" box and adjust the sliders for gravity and friction. This will make objects and characters fly around or slide on the ground depending on your settings. You can also check the "Enable Ragdoll" box to make enemies go limp when they die.
