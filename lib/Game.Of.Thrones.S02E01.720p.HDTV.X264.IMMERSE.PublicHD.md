The episode also shows the aftermath of Ned Stark's execution and the war that has erupted between the five kings: Joffrey Baratheon, Robb Stark, Renly Baratheon, Stannis Baratheon and Balon Greyjoy. Robb is winning battles against the Lannisters and has captured Jaime Lannister as his prisoner. He sends Theon Greyjoy to his father Balon to seek an alliance, and Catelyn Stark to Renly to negotiate a common front. However, both missions prove to be futile, as Balon plans to attack the North and Renly is challenged by his older brother Stannis, who claims to be the rightful heir to the Iron Throne.
 
Stannis is aided by Melisandre, a mysterious priestess of the Lord of Light, who has a powerful influence over him. She convinces him to reject the old gods and burn their statues as a sign of his faith. She also performs a ritual with Stannis that involves leeches and blood magic. She promises him that he will have a son who will help him win the throne.
 
In King's Landing, Tyrion Lannister arrives as the new Hand of the King, appointed by his father Tywin Lannister. He tries to curb Joffrey's cruelty and control his sister Cersei's schemes. He also befriends Shae, a prostitute he met on his way to the capital, and brings her with him despite his father's orders. He discovers that Cersei has ordered the massacre of all of Robert Baratheon's bastards in the city, including a baby girl named Barra who was killed in front of her mother in a brothel owned by Petyr Baelish.
 
One of Robert's bastards, Gendry, manages to escape with Arya Stark, who is disguised as a boy and travelling with Yoren, a recruiter of the Night's Watch. They are joined by other recruits, including Hot Pie, Lommy Greenhands and Jaqen H'ghar, a mysterious prisoner from the black cells. They are attacked by Lannister soldiers led by Ser Amory Lorch, who are looking for Gendry. Yoren is killed defending them, but Arya manages to save Jaqen and two other prisoners from being burned alive. She also lies to Lorch that Lommy, who was killed by a spear through his neck, was Gendry.
 
Meanwhile, Daenerys Targaryen leads her small khalasar across the Red Waste, hoping to find shelter and allies. She sends her three bloodriders in different directions to scout for signs of life. She also struggles to feed her three baby dragons, who refuse to eat anything but meat. She faces starvation, thirst and desertion among her followers. One of her bloodriders, Rakharo, is killed and his severed head is returned to her by a rival khalasar. Another bloodrider, Kovarro, returns with an invitation from the city of Qarth, where he claims they will be welcomed as guests.
 
The episode ends with a shot of the red comet that streaks across the sky, seen by different characters in different locations. It is interpreted differently by different people: some see it as a sign of dragons, some as a sign of blood and fire, some as a sign of their own destiny.
